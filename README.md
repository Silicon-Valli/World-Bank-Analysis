Analysis of the Sub-Saharan Region

**Conducted exploratory data analysis using Python, identifying the most significant challenges of Africa’s Sub-Saharan region. Results show that five features are the main contributors to an underdeveloped Gini Index.**

**Introduction**

Sub-Saharan Africa is becoming one of the fastest developing regions in the world. From the years 2010 to 2015, they have experienced a period of economic growth, strides towards technological processes, increased education, and healthcare implementation. According to Global trends, “…Sub-Saharan Africa will become more populous, youthful, urban, mobile, educated, and networked (Gonzalez, 2020)” in the near future. But with growing pains, the region will face the challenge of supporting a larger population and testing if its capacity and infrastructure can maintain those strides sufficiently throughout. The lack of funding in the educated workforce, military protection, environmental change, youth development, gender equality and healthcare will constantly be influencers in the growth and adaptation of the region.

Sub-Saharan Africa can differ substantially depending on the country itself. That being said, it is relevant to assume that country’s will primarily focus on their own internal threats such as geopolitical and economic threats. As Sub-Saharan Africa is set to have the world’s fastest growing population in the next five years (Gonzalez, 2020), it is a goal that promotion and growth will outweigh the challenges within the region.
